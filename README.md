## Skyfall</br>
This is the end</br>
Hold your breath and count to ten</br>
Feel the Earth move and then</br>
Hear my heart burst again</br>
For this is the end</br>
I've drowned and dreamt this moment</br>
So overdue, I owe them</br>
Swept away, I'm stolen</br>

**Chorus**</br>
Let the sky fall</br>
When it crumbles</br>
We will stand tall</br>
Face it all together</br>
Let the sky fall</br>
When it crumbles</br>
We will stand tall</br>
Face it all together</br>
At Skyfall</br>
At Skyfall</br>

Skyfall is where we start</br>
A thousand miles and poles apart</br>
Where worlds collide and days are dark</br>
You may have my number, you can take my name</br>
But you'll never have my heart</br>

**Chorus**</br>
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)</br>
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)</br>
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)</br>
Face it all together</br>
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)</br>
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)</br>
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)</br>
Face it all together</br>
At Skyfall</br>

**Bridge**</br>
Where you go, I go</br>
What you see, I see</br>
I know I'd never be me</br>
Without the security</br>
Of your loving arms</br>
Keeping me from harm</br>
Put your hand in my hand</br>
And we'll stand</br>

**Chorus**</br>
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)</br>
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)</br>
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)</br>
Face it all together</br>
Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)</br>
When it crumbles (when it crumbles)</br>
We will stand tall (we will stand tall)</br>
Face it all together</br>
At Skyfall</br>

Let the sky fall</br>
We will stand tall</br>
At Skyfall</br>
Ooh</br>

## Pink Pony Club</br>
I know you wanted me to stay</br>
But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in LA</br>
And I heard that there's a special place</br>
Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day</br>

I'm having wicked dreams of leaving Tennessee</br>
Hear Santa Monica, I swear it's calling me</br>
Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene</br>
She sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream</br>

**Pre-Chorus**</br>
God, what have you done?</br>
You're a pink pony girl</br>
And you dance at the club</br>
Oh mama, I'm just having fun</br>
On the stage in my heels</br>
It's where I belong down at the</br>

**Chorus**</br>
Pink Pony Club</br>
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the</br>
Pink Pony Club</br>
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in</br>
West Hollywood</br>
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the</br>
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club</br>

I'm up and jaws are on the floor</br>
Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door</br>
Blacklights and a mirrored disco ball</br>
Every night's another reason why I left it all</br>

I thank my wicked dreams a year from Tennessee</br>
Oh, Santa Monica, you've been too good to me</br>
Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene</br>
She sees her baby girl, I know she's gonna scream</br>

**Pre-Chorus**</br>
God, what have you done?</br>
You're a pink pony girl</br>
And you dance at the club</br>
Oh mama, I'm just having fun</br>
On the stage in my heels</br>
It's where I belong down at the</br>

**Chorus**</br>
Pink Pony Club</br>
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the</br>
Pink Pony Club</br>
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in</br>
West Hollywood</br>
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the</br>
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club</br>

**Bridge**</br>
Don't think I've left you all behind</br>
Still love you and Tennessee</br>
You're always on my mind</br>
And mama, every Saturday</br>
I can hear your southern drawl a thousand miles away, saying</br>

**Pre-Chorus**</br>
God, what have you done?</br>
You're a pink pony girl</br>
And you dance at the club</br>
Oh mama, I'm just having fun</br>
On the stage in my heels</br>
It's where I belong down at the</br>

**Chorus**</br>
Pink Pony Club</br>
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the</br>
Pink Pony Club</br>
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in</br>
West Hollywood</br>
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the</br>
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club</br>

I'm gonna keep on dancing</br>
I'm gonna keep on dancing</br>

## Don't Look Back in Anger</br>
Slip inside the eye of your mind</br>
Don't you know you might find</br>
A better place to play?</br>
You said that you'd never been</br>
But all the things that you've seen</br>
Will slowly fade away</br>

**Pre-Chorus**</br>
So I start a revolution from my bed</br>
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head</br>
Step outside, summertime's in bloom</br>
Stand up beside the fireplace</br>
Take that look from off your face</br>
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out</br>

**Chorus**</br>
And so, Sally can wait</br>
She knows it's too late as we're walkin' on by</br>
Her soul slides away</br>
"But don't look back in anger," I heard you say</br>

Take me to the place where you go</br>
Where nobody knows</br>
If it's night or day</br>
Please don't put your life in the hands</br>
Of a rock 'n' roll band</br>
Who'll throw it all away</br>

**Pre-Chorus**</br>
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed</br>
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head</br>
Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom</br>
Stand up beside the fireplace</br>
Take that look from off your face</br>
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out</br>

**Chorus**</br>
And so, Sally can wait</br>
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by</br>
My soul slides away</br>
"But don't look back in anger," I heard you say</br>

**Chorus**</br>
So, Sally can wait</br>
She knows it's too late as we're walking on by</br>
Her soul slides away</br>
"But don't look back in anger," I heard you say</br>
So, Sally can wait</br>
She knows it's too late as she's walking on by</br>
My soul slides away</br>
"But don't look back in anger</br>
Don't look back in anger," I heard you say</br>

At least not today</br>

## Leaving on a Jet Plane</br>
All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go</br>
I'm standing here outside your door</br>
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye</br>
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn</br>
The taxi's waiting, he's blowin' his horn</br>
Already I'm so lonesome I could die</br>

**Chorus**</br>
So kiss me and smile for me</br>
Tell me that you'll wait for me</br>
Hold me like you'll never let me go</br>
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane</br>
Don't know when I'll be back again</br>
Oh babe, I hate to go</br>

There's so many times I've let you down</br>
So many times I've played around</br>
I tell you now, they don't mean a thing</br>
Every place I go, I'll think of you</br>
Every song I sing, I'll sing for you</br>
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring</br>

**Chorus**</br>
So kiss me and smile for me</br>
Tell me that you'll wait for me</br>
Hold me like you'll never let me go</br>
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane</br>
Don't know when I'll be back again</br>
Oh babe, I hate to go</br>

Now the time has come to leave you</br>
One more time, let me kiss you</br>
Then close your eyes and I'll be on my way</br>
Dream about the days to come</br>
When I won't have to leave alone</br>
About the times I won't have to say</br>

**Chorus**</br>
Kiss me and smile for me</br>
Tell me that you'll wait for me</br>
Hold me like you'll never let me go</br>
'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane</br>
Don't know when I'll be back again</br>
Oh babe, I hate to go</br>

I'm leaving on a jet plane</br>
Don't know when I'll be back again</br>
Oh babe, I hate to go</br>
